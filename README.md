a random word is selected from a statement array of words initialized to the statement (minimum
10 words)
a maximum number of attempts is set
at first it shows how many letters it has with "-"
if a letter has been guessed, replace "-" with the letter, on all its positions
if a letter has not been guessed, go to a list of wrong letters that will be displayed to the user
if you enter a letter that has been entered, ignore it
if all of the letters have been guessed or if the maximum number of attempts has been reached
to end the game

word is guessed, the score will increase by 10

1. Implement the solution in OOP style
2. Apply decoupling principles

displaying information, read from keyboard to get input from user
